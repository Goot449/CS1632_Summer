# CS 1632
Software Quality Assurance

## Course Information

**Taught by:** Bill Laboon (laboon@cs.pitt.edu), GitHub username: laboon  
**Professor's Office Hours:** SENSQ 6305
* Monday: 1:00 PM - 2:30 PM   
* Wednesday: 1:00 PM - 2:30 PM
* or by appointment.  

**Class Time:** M/W 2:30 PM - 4:15 PM.
**Room:** SENSQ 5129

**TA**:  Nannan Wen, GitHub username: NannanWen

**Class GitHub repo:** https://www.github.com/LaboonCourses/CS1632_summer
**Required Text:** _A Friendly Introduction to Software Testing_ by Bill Laboon.
* This is a PDF and is available on Github
  * https://github.com/laboon/software-testing/blob/master/software-testing-laboon-ebook.pdf
  * If you spot a typo or mistake, or suggest an improvement that I use, and file it as a pull request or issue on the source repository (ebook), you can get 0.5 extra percentage point (out of 100), up to 2 percentage points.
  * In other words, if you finish the semester with a 90, but submitted 4 valid issues / typo fixes / whatever, your final grade is 90 + 2, 92.
* If you like, you may purchase a physical copy on Amazon at: http://www.amazon.com/Friendly-Introduction-Software-Testing/dp/1523477377/ or CreateSpace at: https://www.createspace.com/6008739 .  It is $14.95 at either.
  * However, this is NOT NECESSARY.  All material is available online, either in this repository or in the (freely available) PDF version of the book linked above.  Some people prefer to have a physical copy and I have made this book as affordable as I can for those who prefer that.


This course provides students with a broad understanding of modern
software testing and quality assurance. Although it will cover testing
theory, the emphasis is on providing practical skills in software
testing currently used in industry. To that end, it will cover: manual
and automated tests, test-driven and behavior-driven development,
performance testing, and understanding and developing a testing
process.

## Grading

This class will be graded entirely on projects and in-class exercises.  There will be no tests.  Attendance during in-class exercises is necessary for a grade, except under extraordinary circumstances.

Note that I do *not* accept late projects, except for medical or other emergencies.  It is your responsibility to turn projects in on time.

* Projects:
  * Deliverable 1 (Manual test planning) - 10%
  * Deliverable 2 (Unit tests / TDD) - 15%
  * Deliverable 3 (System testing) - 15%
  * Deliverable 4 (Property-Based Testing)- 15%
  * Deliverable 5 (Performance Testing) - 15%
  * Deliverable 6 (Static Analysis) - 10%
  * Deliverable 7 (Rust programming) - 10%
* Class Exercises - 10%

It is strongly recommended that you show up for each class, although I will not take attendance.  I also expect students to take an active part in discussions.  Attendance _will_ be taken for days in which we have in-class exercises or guest lectures, and this will count towards the "class exercises" portion of your grade.

The following grading scale will be used.

Score  | Grade
-----: | ------------------------------
100.00-94.00 | A (A+ for extraordinary work)
93.99-91.00  | A-
90.99-88.00  | B+
87.99-84.00  | B
83.99-81.00  | B-
80.99-78.00  | C+
77.99-74.00  | C
73.99-71.00  | C-
70.99-68.00  | D+
67.99-64.00  | D
63.99-61.00  | D-
60.99-0.00   | F

All groups are expected to do their own work on group projects, but
are more than welcome to collaborate and ask questions with other
groups, the Internet, or other colleagues.  However, do not copy code or
have other students do your work for you!  If any student is caught collaborating or cheating in an
unethical manner, they will automatically receive a 0 (zero) for that assignment, and may be penalized
more harshly based on University of Pittsburgh academic policy.  If you have any questions about
whether or not what you are doing is unauthorized, please feel free to ask me.

Assignments should be committed and pushed to GitHub by the beginning
of class on the due date.  Write-ups are due at the beginning of class.
Late assignments will not be accepted.

If any disputes from groups arise, I will assume that GitHub is the "ground 
truth".  

It is recommended you keep all of your graded assignments until final
grades are posted and accepted, in order to resolve any discrepancies
in grading.

## Attendance

For most days, lecture attendance is not required, but is STRONGLY recommended.
The instructor will try to ensure that all information necessary
will be available via slides and the book, but simply reading them may be
insufficient to understand the concepts thoroughly. 

Presence for group exercise days is required in order to get the full
class participation score.  These will not be rescheduled individually.

## Programming Language Selection

For deliverables 1 through 6, the class will use Java with the appropriate
frameworks (JUnit, Mockito, Selenium, Findbugs).  For the final project, students
will develop a software system using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

If you want to use Java but aren't a fan of Eclipse, information on setting up the [Gradle build tool](https://gradle.org/) with the required packages for this course can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/alexlafroscia/c6757de349b27e34eff6).  

## Disability Services Statement

"The Office of Disability Resources and
Services (DRS) provides a broad range of support services to assist
students with disabilities. Services include, but are not limited to,
tape-recorded textbooks, sign language interpreters, adaptive and
transportation. Contact DRS at 412-648-7890 or 412-383-1355 (TTY) in
216 William Pitt Union or see www.drs.pitt.edu for more computer
technology, Braille translation, and nonstandard exam arrangements,
DRS can also assist students with accessibility to campus housing
information."

## Academic Integrity Statement

"As members of the University of
Pittsburgh community, A&S students are expected to meet the obligation
to exhibit honesty and to respect the ethical standards of the
University community and of their chosen field of study in carrying
out academic assignments. A&S students are therefore expected to
familiarize themselves with the published rules and regulations go to
